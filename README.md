Run both calculator.py and back.py in separate terminal windows.

Send a POST request to the /calculator endpoint of the "Calculator" app, passing your number. The "Calculator" app will send it to the "ai" app on port 5001, which will add 2 and return the result to the "Calculator" app, finally displaying it in your client's response.
